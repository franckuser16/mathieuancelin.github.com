h2. Building JBoss AS7 integration

```
git clone https://github.com/mathieuancelin/jboss-as.git
cd jboss-as
mvn clean install 
```

then your brand new JBoss AS7 distribution will be available in 
`jboss-as/build/target/jboss-as-7.1.2.Final-SNAPSHOT`

you can run it with something like :

`bin/standalone.sh`

and deploy weld-osgi hybrid app in it.
