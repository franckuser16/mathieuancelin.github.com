Today, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/13786738766478890804">David Bosschaert</a> posted a first draft for the OSGi/CDI integration proposal. 

David is a JBoss employee and he is co-chair of the OSGi EEG (Enterprise Expert Group). I met him last year at JUDCon London (JAX London) where I showed him what we've done (at <a href="http://www.serli.com">SERLI</a>) with <a href="https://github.com/mathieuancelin/weld-osgi">Weld-OSGi</a> and he was very enthusiastic about the project.

The proposal is available <a href="https://www.osgi.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=141">here</a> and the draft <a href="https://www.osgi.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=19">here</a> 

You can find David's post <a href="http://blog.osgi.org/2012/05/osgicdi-integration-rfp-available-for.html">here</a>


Don't hesistate to comment the draft and propose new requirements.
