As you may know, I really love dependency injection and in Java EE project I tend to use it a lot. I'm also involved in the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346">CDI 1.1 specification</a> and the <a href="http://seamframework.org/Weld">JBoss Weld</a> project. You also know that I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play! framework</a> (both version 1 and 2) .

A few days ago, I saw a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebort/status/246614894663827456">Guillaume Bort</a>  explaining how to integrate Spring in a Play 2 application (based on the work done from <a href="https://github.com/playframework/Play20/pull/365">https://github.com/playframework/Play20/pull/365</a> ). As I already created a Play plugin to <a href="https://github.com/mathieuancelin/play-cdi">use CDI in a Play 1 application</a>, I wrote a sample application showing how to use CDI in a Play 2 application, based on Guillaume's sample app (thanks for the tip Guillaume). I'm not sure that it is really useful to use CDI in Play application, but here is how to do it anyway.

You can do the same on your app if your using Play 2.1 (you'll have to <a href="https://github.com/playframework/Play20/wiki/BuildingFromSource">build it from sources</a>)

First, you need to add the Weld SE dependency. Here we use Weld SE because it's really easy to bootstrap it programmatically.
In the `project/Build.scala` file, add a dependency to `weld-se`

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3749569.js?file=Build.scala"> </script>

You also need to add an empty (or not) `beans.xml` file in your Play 2 app. so Weld will be able to boot. Just create a `META-INF` folder in the `conf` and create an empty `beans.xml` inside.

Then, you need to use dynamic controller dispatching in your application so Weld will be able to create the controller instances for you. To do that, just prefix your controller class name with the `@` symbol in the `routes` file

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3749569.js?file=routes"> </script>

When you do that, the controllers instances management will be delegated to the `Global` object of your application. Here is an implementation of the `Global` using Weld

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3749569.js?file=Global.java"> </script>

Now, every class in your application is considered as a bean. If you want to exclude some classes, you need to write a CDI extension to veto bean types or you can use libraries like <a href="http://www.seamframework.org/Seam3/Solder">Seam Solder</a> or <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/DeltaSpike/">DeltaSpike project</a> to do the job. So we can write a basic service like the following

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3749569.js?file=HelloService.java"> </script>

and use it in a Java controller

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3749569.js?file=Application.java"> </script>

or even in a Scala controller 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3749569.js?file=ScalaController.scala"> </script>

Note that the controller is a class and not an object. If your controller is an object you won't be able to write something like the following in yoiur `routes` file

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3749569.js?file=routes2"> </script>



As you may have noticed, you can't use web related scope with this implementation. To do so, you need to create a CDI extension that will provide a RequestScoped related context and handle requests from `Global` object to feed that context. I will try to write a blog post about it later.

You can find the sample application <a href="https://github.com/mathieuancelin/play2-cdi">here</a>

<b>UPDATE :</b> I updated my sample app to use CDI Events combined with Iteratees and SSE from both Scala and Java => https://gist.github.com/3755757
